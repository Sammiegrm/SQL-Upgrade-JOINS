As part of my ongoing learning journey at Vephla University, I’ve continued to expand and strengthen my SQL skills. This growth has allowed me to work on several real-life, hands-on projects that have deepened my understanding of data analysis and database management.

Over the coming weeks, I’ll be sharing some of these projects to showcase what I’ve learned so far and to document my progress as I keep developing professionally.
